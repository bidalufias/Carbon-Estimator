# Carbon Estimator
## Getting Started Guide

1. Clone the repository
2. From the main directory, run `bower install`
3. Make sure you have a Web Server, for example the default Apache httpd in Mac OS, or the XAMPP stack (http://www.apachefriends.org)
4. Copy (or preferrably, link) the source code to a directory that the Web Server can serve; for example, in Mac OS, if you have cloned Carbon Footprint Estimator into `~/Projects/CarbonEstimator` and your htdocs is available through XAMPP at `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs`, then use this command to link:

```
ln -s ~/Projects/CarbonEstimator /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/carbon-estimator
```

5. After that, you should be able to access the Carbon Estimator at http://localhost/carbon-estimator
