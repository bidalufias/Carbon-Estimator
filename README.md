# Carbon Estimator

Hello!

To limit climate change to 3.5â„ƒ, globally we must emit no more than 350 gigatons of carbon this century. It is our hope this tool helps people reduce their carbon footprints to make a sustainable future possible.

We believe this is the most intuitive and fastest carbon estimator available that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

Feel free to customise and install it on your own website, and help to spread to as many people as possible!  

## Demo

Try this working demo that was built for Singapore: http://climaterealityproject.asia/calculator

## Getting Started Guide

1. Clone the repository
1. From the main directory, run `bower install`
1. Make sure you have a Web Server, for example the default Apache httpd in Mac OS, or the XAMPP stack (http://www.apachefriends.org)
1. Copy (or preferrably, link) the source code to a directory that the Web Server can serve; for example, in Mac OS, if you have cloned Carbon Footprint Estimator into `~/Projects/CarbonEstimator` and your htdocs is available through XAMPP at `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs`, then use this command to link:

 ```
ln -s ~/Projects/CarbonEstimator /Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/carbon-estimator
```

1. After that, you should be able to access the Carbon Estimator at http://localhost/carbon-estimator
